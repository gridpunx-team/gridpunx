# About gridpunx

Gridpunx is a project which aims to provide the baseline server code for a MUD game using the Evennia MU* creation system (see NOTICE.txt for copyright details).

## Purpose and scope
This code is designed to be used as a baseline for creating worlds in the cyberpunk genre using Evennia, but will not include any pre-made world content. The official gridpunx server's world database and build scripts will not be made open source.
